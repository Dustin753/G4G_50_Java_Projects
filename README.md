# G4G_50_Java_Projects Challenge 

# Overview

To improve my proficiency in not only Java but object-oriented programming,
I am attempting to complete all of the project ideas from the following
GeeksForGeeks article: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/java-projects/. 

# Rules of this Challenge 
1) I must go in order. Going in order will ensure I don't skip a project
   because it seems too hard. I will be forced to learn and implement
   new things.
2) I must plan the project beforehand instead of jumping straight into
   coding. Planning on paper will force me to think the program through
   and hopefully reduce future confusion. 
3) No more than one challenge a day. I don't think this will be a problem,
   since most of the projects will take me several days. But overexertion
   will only lead to burnout, which is not beneficial for my growth as
   a software developer.
4) Have fun. This is a challenge not a graded project. If I feel myself
   becoming too stressed, I'll step away from the computer and come back
   later.

# Benefits of Doing the Challenge 
1) Skill Improvement
2) Experience: I will gain experience working with different types of programs. My mental
   library will be added too, hopefully giving me the tools to complete future tasks more
   easily and efficiently.
3) Consistency: By doing this challenge I'll be coding most days, meaning I'll be
   using (and improving) the tools of my trade.
